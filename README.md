Map resolution (adjustable): 0.1 meters
Testing site: Zhiyi Stadium, Jinming Campus, Henan University (approximately 2000 square meters)
Coverage area: Can build a map of 250m * 250m, but due to poor GPS accuracy, mapping errors are large, so the effect is not ideal.
Experimental equipment: Radar: Livox MID360
GPS module: Brand: Yabo Intelligence, Zhongke Microelectronics. Based on the ATGM336H-5N BDS/GNSS positioning and navigation module. (Error 2.5 meters - 10 meters)
Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04
ROS version: ROS1 Noetic
